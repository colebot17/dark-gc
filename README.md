### Google Classroom Dark Theme

Dark Theme for Google Classroom - Supports both student and teacher views! Although this is mainly a dark theme, there are a couple of minor layout improvements here and there as well.

### Install
The theme is available through [userstyles.world](http://www.userstyles.world) via the [Stylus Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), and through [userstyles.net](http://www.userstyles.net) via the [Stylish Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en).


### Changelog
v.1.2.0 - The Teacher Update
Fixes many bugs, big and small, on the teacher side of the platform, as well as a couple student-side tweaks. With this update, there are now almost no broken or unsupported areas of the site. If you encounter an issue, please report it on GitHub so it can be resolved.
Known Issue: Some context menus do not appear where expected.
Workaround: Use each context menu in its new location.

v.1.1.3 -
Fix color of Google Apps icon
Improve consistency of to-do list items

v.1.1.2 -
Fixed teacher appreciation week banner. This change would theoretically affect any future banners that Google puts up.

v.1.1.1 -
Updated the internal ids of the drop-down setting to be clearer. This means that if you previously selected the "Follow System Theme" mode, you will need to re-select it before updating the style.
Darkened the loading bar at the top - thanks Eduardo Werner!

v.1.1.0 -
Assignments in the classroom page look better on hover and focus
By default, the page is now dark no matter what, but there is a new option to have the page follow the browser-wide theme setting. Previously it would always follow the browser.
Minor improvements

v.1.0.5 -

Minor upkeep due to a few changes on Google's end

Small bug fixes

(Update: only for classes with the blue accent color... this is being fixed)

A couple of minor bug fixes.

v.1.0.0 -
I created this by myself. There are still a few bugs with the teacher view, but it is nearly perfect for students.
